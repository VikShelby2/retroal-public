              Founded in 2018, Velvet Revival began as a passion project to preserve the artistry and craftsmanship of
              bygone eras. We believe that true style transcends time, and every vintage piece carries with it a unique
              story waiting to be continued.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team travels across the globe, sourcing authentic vintage clothing from estate sales, vintage
              boutiques, and private collections. Each piece is carefully inspected, cleaned, and restored to ensure it
              meets our high standards of quality and authenticity.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you choose Velvet Revival, you're not just buying clothing â€“ you're investing in sustainable fashion,
              supporting artisanal craftsmanship, and becoming part of a community that values timeless style over
              fleeting trends.
